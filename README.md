# COMP3025Assignment
A Ski Wax Calculator and Tracker

I have been working at the service desk of a ski club for about 3 years, it is always a struggle trying to find the exact right ski wax for the time of the day.  
I want to make an app that calculates the most ideal ski wax for both grip and glide wax and display the exact stats and an “easy view” with the recommended colours of the wax. 
I also want to implement a tracker to track what ski wax was previously put on my skis to easily track what has been done and what needs to be done for the current conditions

Concepts needed for this assignment:
Access DB for Ski Wax Tracker
Access API for up to date/time weather info
